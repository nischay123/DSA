while the function is not finished executing it will remains in the stack 
when a function finishes executing it is removed from the stask ans the flow of program restored to where it was called

<!-- -->
base condition 
where you want to breack the continous reccursive function calls

if we dont have proper base condition -> results in stask overflow

recusrion- hepls bigger problems to smaller problem in simple ways
you can convert recussive solution to iteration and vice versa
space compexity is not constant because of recursive calls


Imp 
1 identify if problem is breakable
2write the recurence relation if needed
3 draw recursive tree
4 see the floe of function, how  they are getting stack
identify tree calls
draw the tree and position again and again using pen and paper 
use debugger te see the flow
5 see how value are returned on each step and see where te function calls come out , in the end you w
